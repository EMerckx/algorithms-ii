# B-trees - Search

First read the node on the way from the memory

Search the key in the array 
* quickest: binary search
* linear search could be more efficient

3 options:
* The key is found -> stop
* The key is not found and the node is a leaf node -> stop
* The key is not found and the node is an internal node -> search the next subtree
