# External data structures

Sometimes, the data that we use is to big to use it in our memory. That is why we will use external data structures to organize the data.

A first example is to keep the data on a drive. To use the data, you first need to read it from the drive. If you change the data, keep in mind you need to rewrite it on the drive.
* the drive contains pages
* the block-list is a list of these pages
